# Hand Mobility Monitoring and Analysis 

This project uses a Leap Motion controller to track hand movements through a series of games designed to help with hand mobility. These games allow for real-time feedback on how users are progressing through an exercise and if they are archiving their goals. Analysis of the hand tracking allows for a record of progression to be recorded for care providers to create reports that can contain a mixture of both tables and graphs along with their own commentary of results.
